## 3- My Development Process:
**Planning** : 

  1-  Planning my app by doing a brainstorm for the ideas that I want in my app.

  2- then I started to do my sketch on figma.
  
  3- after deciding how my app is gonna look like, I started to define the Specifications required for my app. 
  

**Designing** :

 I used figma to Design my app as a sketch.

**Developing** :

 1- I transformed my sketch into a design in Android Studio

  2- I started to writting my code and my Functions.
  
**Testing** :


I started to testing my app by using developer Tools.



## 4- Unsolved problems:

I tried to use FLOW data instead of Live data for my query functions and I found it really hard to understand by myself when I was searching.

## 5- Favorite Functions:

My favorite function is HideCompleted fun cause when I was working on it, it was interesting and little bit hard

Also it makes my app looks so much better because when want to see what you've done on your tasks you only need to click on your donebox and then click on hide completed tasks and it will disappear.
